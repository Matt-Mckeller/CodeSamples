# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to one of my code sample repositories. Feel free to browse this and my other public repositories for more samples! Feel free to ask any questions. I enjoy coding, software, and continuous improvement. 

Here you can find some examples for both frontend and backend web application development with full stack JavaScript. The code contained here is written with TypeScript/JavaScript/React/Node.js. Originally the code is part of an express.js backend or included by a next.js frontend. Additional technologies are being utilized such as MUI Component Library, GraphQL, GSAP to assist with animations, SVG, and Chart.js. 

These are some extracted code samples, the backend project is in the middle of migration to Nestjs w/ microservices, typeorm, etc. 

For the backend I have been experimenting with code generation and serverless separation while learning to best utilize AI code generation. Started barebones trying to keep it simple then expanding from there. Migrating my primary code to Nestjs and keeping note of the lessons learned for code generation. 

I wanted to know, How much impact can AI code generation have on our development process? How much performance improvement can it offer? What is it good at? My findings: Lots of potential, it speeds up our development and does best with step by step instructions. Its really good at refactoring, transforming from one language to another, and helping with debugging. AI is also really good at turning data into backend code.
