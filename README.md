# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my code sample repository. Here you can find some examples for both frontend and backend web application development. The code contained here is written with TypeScript/JavaScript/React/Node.js. Originally the code is part of an express.js backend or included by a next.js frontend. Additional technologies are being utilized such as MUI Component Library, GraphQL, GSAP to assist with animations, SVG, and Chart.js. 

These code samples are extracted from a full project for easier viewing. The live code is pending updates to React 18/Mui/Next.js for redeployment

For the backend I have been experimenting with code generation and serverless separation while learning to utilize code generation. Keeping it simple. Still developing the architecture, or more likely will move to Nestjs and keep note of the lessons learned for code generation.
