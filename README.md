# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to my code sample repository. Here you can find some examples for both frontend and backend web application development. The code contained here is written with TypeScript/JavaScript/React/Node.js. Originally the code is part of an express.js backend or included by a next.js frontend. Additional technologies are being utilized such as MUI Component Library, GraphQL, GSAP to assist with animations, SVG, and Chart.js. 

These code samples are extracted from a full project for easier viewing.
